## QuestDB - Airbus

QuestDB is the fastest growing open-source time-series database offering¬†**blazingly fast, high throughput ingestion**¬†and¬†**dynamic, low-latency SQL queries**. The entire high-performance codebase is built from the ground up in Java, C++ and Rust with no dependencies and zero garbage collection.

We achieve high performance via a column-oriented storage model, parallelized vector execution, SIMD instructions, and low-latency techniques. In addition, QuestDB is hardware efficient, with quick setup and operational efficiency.

# OLAP

## DuckDB  (In-memory database)

An analytics¬†**in-process**¬†SQL database. Think SQLite, but for analytics. Unlike other popular analytics databases, there is no DBMS server to install, update or maintain. All data is stored in a persistent,¬†****single-file database. DuckDB does not run as a separate process and can query Pandas data directly without importing or copying any data or query foreign data (csv, parquet, json files) without copying¬†[[1]](https://duckdb.org/why_duckdb.html#duckdbissimple)

# Testing

We are choosing **QuestDB, DuckDB, Cassandra and StarRocks**. Following the next criteria:

- **Easy deployment and configuration**: Docker, amount of parts to production ready
- **Plugins, tools and connectors**: Prometeo, Grafana, webviews, etc.
- **Query difficulty**: SQL-like query or self query.
- **Use cases and support**: community, implementations, production cases.
- **Time responses:** How fast are writing and query high scale data.
- **Cost effective**: How expensive are the resources in a production environment, self-hosted and cloud-hosted.

## Instance

**Amazon type t2.2xlarge: 32 RAM - 8vcpu**
We have build a **[Python script](https://github.com/espinozasenior/tsdbs-benchmark)** to write and query 10 millions of rows in my local computer to test how complex is the installation, connection and query building.
